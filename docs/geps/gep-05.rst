Abstract
--------

This GEP describes the implementation of optional rounding of variables in GETTSIM.


Motivation and Scope
--------------------

When transfers and taxes are calculated, in some cases intermediate results or the
final amount need to be rounded based on German law. For some applications, it is
beneficial to also round these variables. These exact results can, for example, be
directly compared to test cases.

However, the rounding leads to non-smooth functions which can hamper numerical
optimization. For these applications, the rounding can be disabled.

Implementation
--------------

GETTSIM only allows for optional rounding of the results of functions. If an
intermediate variable needs to be rounded, the programmer can just split up the code
and create a new function returning exactly this (potentially rounded) result.




Within the code base, rounding parameters are specified in the ``.yaml``-files. The
example below determines that ``grundr_zuschlag_m`` is by law rounded to the second
decimal point. The parameter ``base`` determines the base to which the variables is
rounded and ``direction`` has to be one of ``up``, ``down``, ``nearest``.

.. code-block:: yaml

       rounding:
         grundr_zuschlag_m:
           2020-01-01:
             direction: nearest
             base: 0.01
             reference: Whatever law

At the definition of ``grundr_zuschlag_m`` the decorator
``add_rounding_spec_by_params_file`` applies the respective rounding parameters.

.. code-block:: python

       @add_rounding_spec_by_params_file(PATH_PARAMS_FILES["ges_renten_vers"])
       def grundr_zuschlag_m(
           grundr_zuschlag_vor_eink_anr_m: FloatSeries, anrechenbares_eink_gr_m: FloatSeries
       ) -> FloatSeries:
           pass

The path ``PATH_TO_GES_RENTEN_VERS_PARAMS`` can be imported from config.py. The
decorator adds the attribute ``__roundingspec__`` to the function. When calling
``compute_taxes_and_transfers`` with ``rounding=True``, GETTSIM loops over all
functions and applies the rounding specified in the attribute if the attribute exists.

User-written functions
----------------------

For user-written functions the decorator ``add_rounding_spec`` allows the user to
specify the rounding parameters directly as follows.

 .. code-block:: python

       @add_rounding_spec(base=0.01, direction="nearest")
       def grundr_zuschlag_m(
           grundr_zuschlag_vor_eink_anr_m: FloatSeries, anrechenbares_eink_gr_m: FloatSeries
       ) -> FloatSeries:
           pass


Advantages of this implementation
---------------------------------

This implementation was picked over alternatives (e.g. specifying the rounding
parameters in the ``.py`` files directly) for the following reason:

- Rounding parameters might change over time in the law. In this case, the rounding
  parameters for each time period can be specified in the parameter file.
- How a variable is rounded is a parameter of the tax and transfer system. Hence,
  it seems a better fit to define it there.
- Optional rounding can be also easily specified for self-written functions.
- At the definition of a function, it is clearly visible if it is optionally rounded
  and where the rounding parameters are found.
